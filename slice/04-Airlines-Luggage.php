            <p>Baggage restrictions vary by airline. Many carriers to the Asia/Pacific region allow 2 checked bags per person, and each bag is allowed to weigh 50 lbs. for a total of 100lbs. However, many European-based carriers allow only one 50-lb bag per passenger. Furthermore, changes in each carrier's policies are not unusual. Therefore restrictions cannot be easily summed up. Please visit the web site of your airline to find specific details on what is allowed and what will incur extra fees. If you book your international flights with us we will advise you of any baggage restrictions. Please also note that, if you purchase your domestic flights separately from your international ticket, your domestic carrier will have its own policies regarding how many bags you may bring and how heavy they can be, and the domestic carrier could potentially charge you for ALL bags. Therefore, please check with each individual carrier.</p>
            <p>Most flights within Asia that are NOT legs of an international ticket allow only one piece of luggage weighing 44 lbs. Some internal Asia flights and certain destinations such as Papua New Guinea and Bhutan have very severe weight restrictions. If your destination(s) fall under this case, your Travel Specialist will advise you on exact restrictions.</p>
