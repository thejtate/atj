            <p>We were devastated to learn that Nepal has suffered a second significant earthquake just as recovery efforts from the April 25th quake were beginning. Once again, we are thankful that our Nepalese partners and their families are safe, and grateful for their on-the-ground assistance channeling aid to the areas in most dire need.</p>
            <p>Thanks to our travelers’ and friends’ generous donations, Asia Transpacific Foundation was able to significantly bolster its existing emergency relief funds to send to Nepal. An initial wire transfer has already been sent to our long-time partners on the ground in Kathmandu to provide immediate relief through projects they have personally vetted. The Asia Transpacific Foundation intends to send additional wire transfers to Nepal this week and into the future.</p>
            <p>A few of the projects/areas already receiving our assistance include:</p>
            <ul class="list-style-b">
              <li>Rotary Club of Kantipur: Providing emergency food, water, shelter and medical attention to
                the population of Kathmandu and effected populations throughout the country.</li>
              <li>Simle, Dhading District, Khari Ward 1: Providing clean water to a village northwest of
                Kathmandu whose water supply was contaminated during the earthquake.</li>
              <li>Region of Nuwakot: Providing emergency food, water, shelter and medical attention to this
                devastated agricultural region just north of Kathmandu.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition, our partners are actively seeking out additional avenues to efficiently and effectively disperse our funds as the situation in Nepal evolves.</p>
            <p>If you would like to offer your assistance to Nepal at this tragic and pivotal time, please make your tax-deductible donation via our 501C3 foundation.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your support!</p>
