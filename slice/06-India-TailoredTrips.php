          <h4>TAILORED TRIPS TO INDIA</h4>
          <p>PRIVATE TRAVEL FOR YOU, YOUR FAMILY & FRIENDS</p>
          <p>Custom isn't complicated: in fact over 70% of our travelers travel to India on a Tailored Trip. And here's the beauty, a Tailored Trip to India departs on dates of your choosing and you travel only in the company of loved ones to destinations entirely up to you. You determine the trip length and focus. The type of India lodging is up to you, as are included meals. All trips are accompanied by expert private local guides and drivers, all for about the price of a group departure (or if you choose, the sky is of course the limit).</p>
          <p>You can also customize one of our signature <a href="#">Small Group Trips</a> to suit your travel dates.</p>
