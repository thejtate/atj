            <h4>THE FINE DETAILS</h4>
            <p>Small Group Trips are a collection of distinctive itineraries with special touches for your group, expert local guides at each destination, daily activities and entry fees, visa fees, tips to local staff, airport departure taxes on group flights, ground transportation, private airport transfers, Emergency Evacuation and Emergency Medical travel insurance, and a customized Travel Guide specific to your journey.</p>
