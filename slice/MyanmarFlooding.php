            <p>As you may be aware, heavy monsoon rains have caused widespread flooding throughout much of central and western Myanmar. Many communities have been devastated by the floodwaters and resulting landslides, and many others are suffering major disruptions of basic infrastructure. Thus far, it is estimated that over 150,000 homes and 100,000 acres of farmland have been damaged and at least 30 Burmese have lost their lives. With no end to this devastating situation in sight, we feel compelled to do everything in our power to assist the Burmese people during this difficult time.</p>
            <p>Working with our partners on the ground, the Asia Transpacific Foundation is collecting donations to bolster its existing emergency relief funds to send to Myanmar. Our partners are actively seeking out avenues to most efficiently and effectively disperse our funds as the situation in Myanmar evolves. </p>
            <p>If you would like to offer your assistance to Myanmar at this pivotal time, please make your tax-deductible donation via our 501C3 foundation.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your support!</p>
