            <p>The Asia Transpacific Foundation invests in a variety of carefully selected initiatives that support education, conservation, sustainable economic development and emergency relief in Asia and the Pacific. We invite our travelers (and our staff) to visit these projects in person during their travels to strengthen the personal connection that has always been at the heart of our efforts.</p>
            <p>Our foundation’s first major project was the Clean Water Initiative in Myanmar (Burma). This initiative provided clean water to children and families in need to improve their standard of living and ensure the future health and vitality of their communities. We’ve celebrated the ultimate success of this project by turning it over to the Burmese people as a self-sustainable, community-based project.</p>
