            <div class="text">
              <p>The Khmer ruins at Angkor are the greatest sight in Asia. The visible central portion extends across an area the size of Manhattan. Recent satellite images reveal the actual extent of the one-time capital to be comparable to present-day Los Angeles, making it the largest city on Earth dating from the pre-industrial era. The temples represent one of humankind's most astonishing and enduring artistic and architectural achievements-one beholds them with a humbling sense of awed wonder.

            <p>The great thing about planning your custom Cambodia journey at present are the amazing new areas that are opening up to travelers, as well as accommodations such as  French colonial mansions being restored deep in the countryside. A Cambodia vacation should try to include Battambang, Banteay Chhmar and Sambor Prei Kuk—obscure places that are home to spectacular Khmer Empire ruins, yet rarely see visitors.</p>

            <h4>CAMBODIA HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
            <p>If you travel to Cambodia on a customized basis, you could explore the ruins of Sambor Prei Kuk by local bicycle and have lunch amidst the ruins; ride elephants in remote Sen Monorom; cruise by boat from Phnom Penh to the Mekong Delta; and travel overland from Cambodia to Thailand via the Cardamom Mountains, staying overnight in a luxury floating tented camp.  On our classic group tour of Cambodia you will visit all Cambodia’s iconic sites such as Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and the graceful Citadel of Women, then explore lovely Tonle Sap (Great Lake), where traditional ways of life still flourish amidst the stilted homes and floating water gardens.</p>

            <h4>CONNECT WITH CAMBODIANS</h4>
            <p>Furthermore, some travelers like to include an activity, interlude or interaction whereby they can give back to the communities they visit. If you plan to travel to Cambodia, you may find that volunteering is a way to deepen your connection to the people and culture of the area. If this appeals to you, it is possible to visit projects of the Cambodia/Dutch Organization, our longtime affiliate, to experience firsthand the efforts of an NGO in a developing country. Visit schools and field hospitals with the CDO staff to gain unique insight into the Cambodian culture and countryside.</p>

            <h4>CAMBODIA BEACHES</h4>
            <p>Beaches in Cambodia are coming into their own as some of Asia’s most sought-after destinations. Kep is returning to its former glory, complete with abundant national park areas and rocky, black-sand beaches. Nearby Rabbit Island offers beautiful white sand beaches and the shallow sea is ideal for swimming and snorkeling. Kompong Som  has exorcised the ghosts of Khmer Rouge destruction to reclaim its place as Cambodia’s premier beach destination. Numerous newly opened and renovated resorts are making “Snookyville” the next great Asian beach utopia. And Kampot is a great little beach for those who want to get away from it all. Luxurious resorts are springing up on Cambodia’s islands, so ask about the latest haven.</p>

            <p>Cambodia is a land of incredible beauty, rich customs, vibrant festivals, and warm, welcoming people. Until recently many off-the-beaten-path areas were unsafe due to landmines strewn throughout the countryside. However, some areas have been cleared of any danger, and newly renovated villas are beginning to dot the countryside. Finally, trekking has come to Cambodia.</p>

            <h4>TREKS & 4WD</h4>
            <p>Take a multi-day trek through extremely remote Ratanakiri province, or Chuor Phnom Kravanh (the Cardamom Mountains). In particular the area around Ban Lung is noted for overnight trekking.</p>

            <h4>ELEPHANT JUNGLE SAFARI</h4>
            <p>Ban Lung is also a wonderful area for an elephant ride through the jungle, one of the many exhilarating things to do in Cambodia. No hordes of tourists out this far, in fact we'll go out on a limb and say you'll be the only traveler in sight.</p>

            <p>Bon Om Tuk, the Water Festival at Tonle Sap (October or November, depending on lunar cycle) is the country's greatest celebration. This major Cambodia festival marks the changing of the flow of the Tonle Sap and is also seen as thanksgiving to the Mekong River. Boat races date in traditional long canoes recall the strength of the powerful Khmer marine forces during the height of empire. Hundreds of brightly colored boats with over 50 paddlers battle it out for top honors.</p>

This celebration alerts the nation to the commencement of the rainy season and ploughing period. Cows are given a variety of crops to eat. Based on the choices they make while eating, predictions are made for the coming year's harvest.</p>
