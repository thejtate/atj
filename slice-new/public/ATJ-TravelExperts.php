          <h3>jennifer boyd</h3>
          <p>Jen was majoring in Wildlife Biology before a study abroad program in New Zealand presented a fork in the road, and choosing travel, she’s never looked back. She graduated from Colorado State University with a degree in Eco Tourism and has since traveled to nearly 40 countries, absorbing deep firsthand knowledge of Asia and beyond.
