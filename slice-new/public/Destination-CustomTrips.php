          <h2>SMALL GROUP TRIP TO MUMBAI, TAMIL NADU & KERALA</h2>
          <p> <strong>PRIVATE TRAVEL FOR YOU, YOUR FAMILY & FRIENDS</strong> </p>
          <p>Custom isn't complicated: in fact over 70% of our travelers travel to India on a Custom Trip. And here's the beauty, a Custom Trip to India departs on dates of your choosing and you travel only in the company of loved ones to destinations entirely up to you. You determine the trip length and focus. The type of India lodging is up to you, as are included meals. All trips are accompanied by expert private local guides and drivers, all for about the price of a group departure (or if you choose, the sky is of course the limit).
          </p>
          <p>To get started, view our India sample itinerary below or customize one of our signature Small Group Trips to suit your travel dates.</p>

        <h2>HERE ARE SOME IDEAS</h2>
        <ul class="list-style-a">
          <li>Purchase a camel for the price of a tune up at the Pushkar fair. Sell it and donate proceeds to the local orphanage</li>
          <li>Enjoy a private dinner at the residence of an expert on Indian art, whose wife is a gourmet chef</li>
          <li>Get a massage in the Ayurvedic tradition or practice yoga at a holistic center</li>
          <li>Immerse yourself in the urban action with a cyclo tour of Delhi</li>
          <li>Journey far into the Thar Desert on a two-day camel trek</li>
          <li>Overnight in a Bishnoi eco-village. These peaceful people have defended trees at the cost of their own lives</li>
