                    <h5>What?</h5>
                    <p>Camp Leakey - Along the way, the river narrows to the point where, in places, you are passing underneath thick forest canopy and your passage seems almost impossible. Keen observation will be rewarded by occasional glimpses of colorful birds including rhinoceros hornbills, kingfishers, flycatchers and many species of primates. Established in 1971, Camp Leakey was founded by Dr. Birute Galdikas. Like her peers Diane Fossey and Jane Goodall, she was supported by the late Louis Leakey to study large primates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      On arrival at Camp Leakey's river pier, you're likely to be greeted by some of the resident orangutans. Spend the rest of day hiking through the Borneo rainforest, searching for wildlife and exploring the swamp and lowland dipthocarp forests displaying numerous varieties of epiphytes, liana, mosses and ferns. Return to Camp Leakey to view the afternoon feeding of the resident orangutans, followed by the dusk cruise back to the jungle lodge.
