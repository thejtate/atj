[FLT]Fly Hong Kong to Hanoi on Vietnam Airlines VN 593, departing 14:30, arriving 15:35
Economy Class[FLT/]

[EBODY]Welcome to Vietnam! A VIP Immigration service has been arranged for your arrival. Immediately after exiting the aircraft, you will be met on the aero bridge leading into the terminal by a special airport representative holding a sign with your names on it. If your plane parks on the tarmac, you will be shuttled to the terminal instead, in which case you will be met at the terminal door where you are dropped off. You will then be fast-tracked through Immigration and Customs. All visa fees have been prepaid and are included with your program—(please also refer to your Vietnam VIP Visa On Arrival Special Program Note, included at the end of these documents).
After obtaining your Vietnam Visas, you will then be escorted to collect your luggage. At the exit of Customs, the representative will direct you toward the meeting point in the Arrivals Hall where your English-speaking guide, a representative of ATJ, will be holding a sign with your names or ATJ on it.
Please note: Always look for a representative with an Ann Tours uniform, Ann Tours sign, or an ATJ sign and your names. Do not respond to people who have a sign with your name but lack these company logos. 
You will then be privately transferred to your centrally located boutique hotel for a much-deserved night's rest.

Once called Faifo, Hoi An was the most important pport of Vietnam during colonial and pre-colonial times. Due to the monsoons, many trading vessels (Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Arab, Indian, Dutch, French and even Portuguese) had to stop here to wait for the wind to change direction. During the months between monsoons, these merchants built lodgings and trading houses, and their influence can still be seen today in the town's unique and varied architecture and culture.  \rIn more recent times, the port of Hoi An continually silted up and became impractical for larger, modern-day vessels, so it was relocated to Da Nang, leaving Hoi An as an almost forgotten museum of architecture before its more recent rebirth and redevelopment as a result of tourism.\rSites visited today will include the Japanese Covered Bridge, Tang Ky House and the Phuoc Kien Pagoda—fine examples of the stylistic syncretism of this vibrant community. \rThis afternoon, you'll be driven to the 4th-century Cham religious sanctuary of My Son. Visiting later in the afternoon will help you avoid the morning crowds at this small site and also provide wonderful, soft light for photography. My Son, which is classified as a World Heritage site by UNESCO, is located in a beautiful, green valley surrounded by impressive mountains. While it is a small site, the ruins at My Son are the largest and most intact remaining in Vietnam. It is also the home of the Museum of Cham Sculpture, which records the development of the culture and history of the Cham people through their elaborate sculptures and carvings.\rLate in the day, you'll return to your hotel. Enjoy the evening on your own.\rOvernight at the Essence Hoi An Hotel (Balcony Deluxe Double) - Hoi An[EBODY/]\r",

Quan An Ngon is designed with seating in a spacious courtyard surrounding a giant central tree, with food stalls on all four sides cooking food to order. Prices are quite reasonable, so feel free to sample and try a variety of dishes. The stalls are organized into categories of food, such as noodle soups, dry noodles, salads and wraps. Recommended dishes include the ubiquitous pho (traditional noodle soup), but also other northern specialties, like banh cuon (rice flour pancakes with mushrooms and minced pork), muc xien nuong (fresh grilled squid skewers), bun bo thit nuong (grilled pork with rice noodles) and salat xoai xang hai san (seafood and green mango salad). Quan An Ngon is also one of the few places where you can get a taste of southern street foods, such as banh xeo (a savory crepe with shrimp and pork), goi cuon (Vietnamese fresh spring rolls) and chao tom (grilled shrimp patties on sugar cane).\rThen visit Hoa Lo prison museum, otherwise known as \"the Hanoi Hilton.\" Built by the French to house Vietnamese revolutionaries, it was later used to keep captured American POWs during the wartime.

Rise eearly and you will have the opportunity to witness this moving scene typical of old Laos—long lines of barefooted monks weaving through the streets on their alms rounds.\rIn keeping with ATJ's respectful stance regarding local cultures, please observe this sacred ritual from a polite distance. We also encourage that if you must take photographs that it does not interfere with this highly revered practice.\rAfterwards, head out for a walking tour of Luang Prabang, a UNESCO World Heritage City. Start with a visit Wat Xieng Thong, one of the over 30 Buddhist temples and monasteries in town. This exquisite, 400-year-old, royal monastic complex is set on the banks of the Mekong surrounded by massive Banyan Trees that are nearly as old as the monastery. From here, explore small side streets, along back alleys and through temples—a city that could have been designed with slow travel in mind, the morning walking tour will allow you to soak up the ambiance and appreciate the hidden charms of Luang Prabang. Through your guide, feel free to ask the locals questions as they go about their daily lives.\rContinue wandering up the peninsula, stopping at temples and other sites as you wish. If interested, visit the National Museum, which is the former Royal Palace. Relics from Laos' royalist past remain here. Overlooking the palace is Phousi Mountain. It is said that those who do not climb the 328 steps up have not really made it to the city. Venture up the hill and be rewarded with remarkable views of the area. During the day you will also visit the Traditional Arts and Ethnology Center, a nonprofit museum dedicated to the ethnic cultures in Laos.\rReturn to the hotel afterwards for a chance to freshen up and relax a little.\rLater, you'll be taken to enjoy a private traditional baci ceremony, held to celebrate a special event, whether a marriage, a homecoming, or a departure. It is based on an ancient belief that the human being is a union of 32 organs and a kwan (soul) that watches over each of them. Since a wayward kwan is often the attributed cause of an illness or bad fortune, the baci ceremony calls the kwan back to the body from wherever it may be roaming and reestablishes equilibrium. The mohkwan is a village elder that will chant and call the kwan. At the end of the ceremony, the village elders wrap a white cotton thread around your wrist, while chanting an invocation to strengthen the power of the blessings. In Laos, white is the color of peace, good fortune, honesty and warmth.\rOvernight at the Le Sen Boutique Hotel (Deluxe Room) - Luang Prabang[EBODY/]\r",

The weaving techniques employed in Ban San Khong date back many centuries and are used to create some of Asia's most highly prized textiles. Some villagers are also engaged in sa paper production.\rIn the second village, Ban Sang Hai, locals produce Lao Lao, a rice whisky. After a brief stop, continue your tour to Ban Pac Ou, where you will board a boat to reach the Pac Ou caves.\rPeering into dark corners, your eyes gradually adjust to reveal the serene faces and figures of more than 3,000 Buddha images, some inlaid with semiprecious stones. That these remain undisturbed in this remote site in one of the world's poorest countries is a testament to the devotion of the people. Return by boat to Luang Prabang, cruising along the Mekong and enjoying the lush river life along its banks while sipping a drink and tasting Lao snacks.\rOvernight at the Le Sen Boutique Hotel (Deluxe Room) - Luang Prabang[EBODY/]\r",

The temples were built from the  9th to 12th centuries by a Khmer empire that controlled not only Cambodia but also large parts of what are now Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. With their grandeur of scale and an extraordinary delicacy in detail, the temples rank among mankind's supreme artistic expressions.\rThis morning, focus on the Angkor Thom complex, including Phimeanakas, Baphuon, the Terrace of the Elephants, the Terrace of the Leper King and finally the Bayon, with its mysterious towers and beautiful bas reliefs.\rYou will then visit the Bayon Information Center, which serves to enhance visitors' understanding and appreciation of the Angkor monuments. The Bayon Information Center is an interpretative collection of historical information and artifacts of the Khmer Empire, and also documents, catalogues and encourages the conservation of the Angkor Archeological Park.\rUpon arrival, you will be welcomed by the Center's expert  in charge of rebuilding and restoring the Bayon Temple's Southern Library, who will present various videos, images and artifacts related to Khmer history, and will also discuss current restoration projects. Afterwards, visit the Bayon Southern Library site, where you will witness reconstruction firsthand, as well as learn about ancient construction methods used and the difficulties encountered in such an endeavor. You will also tour the entire Bayon site with the expert before this special, behind-the-scenes tour ends.\rLater in the day, visit Ta Phrom in the soft afternoon light and when there are not too many tourists around. Built in 1186, Ta Phrom was dedicated to the mother of Jayavarman VII. Its atmospheric dark gray sandstone towers and courtyards exude an aura of reverence and mystery. Unlike the other temples of Angkor, Ta Phrom has been left to the elements and looks very much like the other temples must have looked when \"discovered\" by Henri Mouhot in the 1860s. Navigating through its narrow passages, immense kapok trees and its jungle-covered ruins is an unparalleled experience, one of the highlights of Angkor.\rAs dusk falls you'll return to your hotel with a chance to relax and freshen up. This evening, we've included a wonderful dinner for you at Cuisine Wat Damnak. It's one of the best restaurants in town and reservations are necessary. This is not an experience you want to miss! Transfers to and from dinner are included. \rOvernight at the Sojourn Boutique Villas (Terrace Room) - Siem Reap[EBODY/]\r",

Built as the funnerary temple for Suryavarman II, who ruled from 1112 to 1152, Angkor never fails to reward the first-time or repeat visitor with its grand scale, surreal bas-reliefs and unbelievable attention to detail. Here, you will spend the morning exploring one of man's most magnificent creations before returning to your hotel for a late breakfast.\rYou will then explore an area in the remote Cambodian countryside seen by few travelers and experience a special day of interaction with local children who participate in projects sponsored by the Cambodian-Dutch Organization, a non-profit that works on community development projects.\rFirst-stop will be at a health center, founded in 2001, which delivers medical services to the locals living in a village called Chhuk. Among their more successful projects was \"Glasses Day\" where over 1,000 pairs of eyeglasses were donated from the Netherlands and distributed among the local population. \rContinue to a small school where young monks are learning English. Then, proceed to a primary school built by the foundation, to meet with the teacher and students. The instructor, Mr. Lous, will introduce you to the class, and you will have an opportunity to do a \"show and tell\" about your life back home. You can talk about your life, your work, your family and your hobbies. The children of this school are eager to learn English and to learn about the world outside Cambodia, and welcome a visitor with enthusiasm, since so few travelers make it out to their rural home.\rNext, you'll drive to Andong Pei village and explore Prasat Banteay Ampil, a remote temple ruin. Chances are you will be the only people around exploring this site. The temple has been taken over by jungle vegetation and is quite exotic. \rEnjoy a pre-packed boxed lunch today.\rIf interested, and time permitting, later this afternoon you might like to visit Les Artisans d'Angkor. This is a network of Cambodian craftsmen and women sponsored by the Cambodian government and \"REPLIC,\" a European program. The purpose is to educate young Cambodians in skills (woodcarving, stone carving, lacquer ware and silk weaving) and provide them with a livelihood by marketing their products. This visit allows for an insight in present day Cambodia and is great for some last minute souvenir shopping.\rYou will then be returned to your hotel where you will have the evening at leisure to explore independently.\rOvernight at the Sojourn Boutique Villas (Terrace Room) - Siem Reap[EBODY/]\r",
